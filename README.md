# Codecademy Vancouver Commuters Project
## Project description
Vancouverâ€™s public metro system wants a program that can help commuters get from one landmark to another by calculating the shortest route between two nearby metro stations. For the purposes of this project, you can assume that it takes the same amount of time to get from each station to each of its connected neighboring stations.

## Project purpose
To practice creating and using graphs, breadth-first and depth-first search.
